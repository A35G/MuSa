# MuSa
Art and Cinema: the *Tenth Muse*

# Introduction

**Cinema** has often been referred to as the *Tenth Muse*, unknown to the ancients and so beloved to this day.

Many streaming platforms have emerged to compete with multi-screen cinemas (small and large) and to enter the everyday life of our homes.

All of us surely have some video (personal or *movie backups*) on our PCs; why not make a mini environment that resembles a local, home-based streaming platform?

The **MuSa project** was created precisely with the intention of collecting in a JSON file a few short pieces of information presenting our multimedia video archive via an intuitive web interface.

# Preview

With the first version currently available you will get what can be seen in the screenshots available below.
With each advancement, the screenshots will be updated to reflect the new features included.
