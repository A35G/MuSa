Art and Cinema: the *Tenth Muse*

# Introduction

**Cinema** has often been referred to as the *Tenth Muse*, unknown to the ancients and so beloved to this day.

Many streaming platforms have emerged to compete with multi-screen cinemas (small and large) and to enter the everyday life of our homes.

All of us surely have some video (personal or *movie backups*) on our PCs; why not make a mini environment that resembles a local, home-based streaming platform?

The **MuSa project** was created precisely with the intention of collecting in a JSON file a few short pieces of information presenting our multimedia video archive via an intuitive web interface.
